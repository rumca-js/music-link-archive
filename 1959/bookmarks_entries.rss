Sun is sinking in the west 
The cattle go down to the stream 
The redwing settles in the nest 
It's time for a cowboy to dream 

Purple light in the canyon 
that is where I long to be 
With my three good companions 
just my rifle pony and me 

Gonna hang my sombrero 
on the limb of a tree 
Coming home sweet my darling 
just my rifle pony and me 

Whippoorwill in the willow 
sings a sweet melody 
Riding to Amarillo 
just my rifle pony and me 

No more cows to be ropin' 
No more strays will I see 
'round the bend shell be waitin 
For my rifle pony and me 
For my rifle my pony and me

Lyrics - Cindy

I wish I was a apple hangin' in a tree
And everytime my sweetheart passed
She'd take a bite off me
She told me that she loved me
She called me sugar plum
She threw her arms around me
I thought my time had come.

Get along home, Cindy-Cindy
Get along home, Cindy-Cindy
Get along home, Cindy]]</description><pubDate>1959-04-22T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uuAjwvtxEM</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uuAjwvtxEM</guid>
