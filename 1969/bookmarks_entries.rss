<item><title>![CDATA[King Crimson - The Court Of The Crimson King]]</title><description>![CDATA[THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING 
including THE RETURN OF THE FIRE WITCH and THE DANCE OF THE PUPPETS  
(McDonald, Sinfield)

The rusted chains of prison moons 
Are shattered by the sun. 
I walk a road, horizons change 
The tournament's begun. 
The purple piper plays his tune, 
The choir softly sing; 
Three lullabies in an ancient tongue, 
For the court of the crimson king. 

The keeper of the city keys 
Put shutters on the dreams. 
I wait outside the pilgrim's door 
With insufficient schemes. 
The black queen chants 
the funeral march, 
The cracked brass bells will ring; 
To summon back the fire witch 
To the court of the crimson king. 

The gardener plants an evergreen 
Whilst trampling on a flower. 
I chase the wind of a prism ship 
To taste the sweet and sour. 
The pattern juggler lifts his hand; 
The orchestra begin. 
As slowly turns the grinding wheel 
In the court of the crimson king]]</description><pubDate>1969-12-17T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukgraQ-xkp4</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukgraQ-xkp4</guid>
<item><title>![CDATA[King Crimson - Epitaph (Including "March For No Reason" and "Tomorrow And Tomorrow")]]</title><description>![CDATA[EPITAPH 
including MARCH FOR NO REASON and TOMORROW AND TOMORROW  
(Fripp, Lake, McDonald, Giles, Sinfield)


The wall on which the prophets wrote 
Is cracking at the seams. 
Upon the instruments of death 
The sunlight brightly gleams. 
When every man is torn apart 
With nightmares and with dreams, 
Will no one lay the laurel wreath 
As silence drowns the screams. 


Between the iron gates of fate, 
The seeds of time were sown, 
And watered by the deeds of those 
Who know and who are known; 
Knowledge is a deadly friend 
When no-one sets the rules. 
The fate of all mankind I see 
Is in the hands of fools. 


Confusion will be my epitaph. 
As I crawl a cracked and broken path 
If we make it we can all sit back and laugh. 
But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying, 
Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying.
