Then she had a transatlantic number-one hit with \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\", which showed her provocative but good-natured style, and which popularized and made her synonymous with go-go boots. The promo clip featured a big-haired Sinatra and six young women in tight tops, go-go boots and mini-skirts. The song was written by Lee Hazlewood, who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets, including \"Some Velvet Morning\". In 1966 and 1967, Sinatra charted with 13 titles, all of which featured Billy Strange as arranger and conductor.\r\n\r\nSinatra also had a brief acting career in the mid-60s including a co-starring role with Elvis Presley in the movie Speedway, and with Peter Fonda in The Wild Angels.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1950s, Sinatra began to study music, dancing, and voice at the University of California in Los Angeles.
