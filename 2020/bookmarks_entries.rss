Jan. 3, 2019 | Bob Boilen -- I've got to wonder just what Daniel Norgren remembers of his performance at the Tiny Desk. For almost the entirety of his blissful performance, the bluesy Swedish musician kept his eyes tightly shut, as he seemed to tap into old souls to help conjure his tunes. He and his band play music steeped in American roots music, and his delivery recalls the way the Irish singer Van Morrison voices his soulful sounds. I can hear a Southern drawl in these slow, mournful songs.

Daniel Norgren has been self-releasing his analog recordings for nearly a dozen years. At the Tiny Desk, he and his band sampled music from three different records — the oldest of which, "Mo]]</description><pubDate>2020-01-10T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHVLEst0-5g</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHVLEst0-5g</guid>

Jan. 27, 2020 | Sidney Madden -- "It's been a fairly short musical journey and we have seen fairly much success," Koffee told the NPR Music offices between songs during her Tiny Desk set. Flashing her braces with each grin, Jamaica's 19-year old tour de force wasn't exaggerating. Her debut EP, Rapture, just won a 2020 Grammy for Best Reggae Album, making her the first woman and the youngest artist to ever win in the category.

March 2, 2020 | Felix Contreras -- When I produce a Tiny Desk Concert, one of my most important jobs is to make sure they run on time and that the performance sticks to our set time limit (roughly 15-minutes). So when Bob Weir and Wolf Bros achieved lift-off during a pre-show sound-check, it was my unthinkable responsibility to tell the guy who practically invented the jam band to... stop jamming.

Weir is a founding member of Grateful Dead, a band that launched countless jams from 1965 until the death of lead guitarist Jerry Garcia in 1995. And it also fell to me to keep looking at my watch during the performan]]</description><pubDate>2020-03-09T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_gUwdPrNY</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l_gUwdPrNY</guid>

My country (Malaysia) is now on partial lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I've a lot of time at home, so I decided to put together a jam session of 'I'm A Dude'.

Equipment used:
- Elektron Octatrack MkII
- Novation Circuit
- Korg Microkorg XL+
- Teenage Engineering OP-1
- Fender Stratocaster w Vintage Noiseless pickups
- Fender Precision Bass
- myVolts mickXer

Music-nerd stuff:
This jam is DAWless. All the recording, playback and sequencing was done within the Octatrack.
The Octatrack is master clock, sending MIDI clock out to the Microkorg. It's not clocked to the Circuit because I haven't yet got the Type B MIDI dongles it needs (I recently got it used and it didn't come with them). So I'm just setting the tempo manually and hitting Play at the right time. The OP-1 Microkorg, Bass & Guitar (thru a Zoom B1xon & G1xon on the floor) all go into the myVolts mic]]</description><pubDate>2020-03-18T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHWJUh9jfnU</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHWJUh9jfnU</guid>

I'm getting a hang of this live jam thing. This time I tried something different. Details below.

Equipment used:
- Elektron Octatrack MkII
- Novation Circuit
- Korg Minilogue
- Korg Microkorg XL+
- Teenage Engineering OP-1
- iConnectAudio4+
- Fender Stratocaster w Vintage Noiseless pickups
- Fender Precision Bass
- myVolts mickXer

Music-nerd stuff:
This jam is DAWless. All the recording, playback and sequencing was done within the Octatrack.
The Octatrack is the master clock, which is sent via MIDI DIN to the iConnectAudio4+ (ica4+), which sends midi out via usb to the Circuit, OP-1, Microkorg. I somehow couldn't get the Minilogue clock to work properly with the usb clock - will figure it out later. Also, the Microkorg tends to drift, so after many bars, the clock sometimes goes out of sync with the Octatrack, which is a bummer. Need to figure out a more robust sy]]</description><pubDate>2020-03-20T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMNY3XgTvyQ</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMNY3XgTvyQ</guid>

Wanted to try out looping acoustic percussion, so here it is.

Equipment used:
- Elektron Octatrack MkII
- Novation Circuit
- Korg Microkorg XL+
- iConnectAudio4+
- Fender Stratocaster w Vintage Noiseless pickups
- Fender Precision Bass
- myVolts mickXer
- Tambourine, Hand Jingle, Woodblock thing from Bali.

Music-nerd stuff:
This jam is DAWless. All the recording, playback and sequencing was done within the Octatrack.
The Octatrack is the master clock, which is sent via MIDI DIN to the iConnectAudio4+, which sends midi out via usb to the Circuit and Microkorg. This time I didn't use the OP-1 or the Minilogue for the jam - kept it simple.
I used the Octatrack Arranger for this one, manually moving the arrangement to the next step from the percussion looping part, as I didn't know how long I wanted to be looping those instruments. The rest were Arranger sequenced, an]]</description><pubDate>2020-03-22T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkX2d_xr7Kk</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkX2d_xr7Kk</guid>

The human race has lived and shared this space we call Earth with the animal kingdom for millions of years but today most cultures have abandoned the idea that humans are animals like the others Our modern societies have been treating Mother Earth as if it was their property extracting resources polluting constantly changing the landscape killing the other animals we and destroying its natural balance.

Since the Industrial Revolution, humanity has killed 83 per cent of all wild mammals and half of all plants of the Earth Two hundred species of living beings are going extinct every single day We collectively need to change so many things in areas such as the use of plastic meat consumption, contaminating energies day to day overconsumption and more How can artists raise awareness regarding this.

"I realized that with time, with a lot of thinking, I did realize that I have been writing about two very different parts, but of the same process I would say," she says. "So it makes very much sense spiritually and musically to split it into two parts, so it makes sense now."]]</description><pubDate>2020-04-28T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti1Iae6AcaU</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ti1Iae6AcaU</guid>

*Best heard on headphones or full-range speakers*
Here's a live looping jam of COVID-19 with *that* guy's voice. (I tried to keep it low)

Equipment used:
- Elektron Octatrack MkII
- Moog SUB37
- Novation Circuit
- Korg Microkorg XL+
- iConnectAudio4+
- Fender Stratocaster w Vintage Noiseless pickups
- Teenage Engineering OP-1
- myVolts mickXer

Music-nerd stuff:
This jam is DAWless. All the recording, playback and sequencing was done within the Octatrack.
The Octatrack is the master clock, which is sent via MIDI DIN to the iConnectAudio4+ (ica4+), which sends midi out via usb to the Circuit, Microkorg, OP-1 and SUB37. I had an issue with noise coming in from USB on the Circuit so disconnected it (which meant I had no MIDI synced start-stop) and I manually pressed play together to sync the Octa and Circuit. It's probably slightly off, but ok. Also, I experimented with MI]]</description><pubDate>2020-05-03T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOGLML98uhU</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOGLML98uhU</guid>

We will continue releasing Tiny Desk videos of shows that had already been taped. In light of current events, NPR is postponing new live tapings of Tiny Desk Concerts. In the meantime, check out Tiny Desk (home) concerts! They’re recorded by the artists in their home. It’s the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Frances Quinlan showed up to NPR HQ in Washington, D.C., in February, just after Presidents' Day — which explains her multiple mid-performance jokes about White House residents. But even if her Tiny Desk concert had happened in July, the allusions wouldn't have surprised me. As a songwriter, Quinlan is piercingly astute at making connections between her present reality and the wider world; her songs often narrate other stories she's heard, fictional or real, from a place of wide-eyed empathy. (It's unclear, however, whether George Washington']]</description><pubDate>2020-05-20T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjXNLLlbnRc</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjXNLLlbnRc</guid>

He passed away on November 6, 1893 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. I hope that while listening to this playlist you are able to have deeper concentration and focus on whatever you are working on.

May 27, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- For me, it was beyond surreal to watch Wire performing at my desk, in broad daylight, in 2020. I spent many an evening over the past 40 years, listening to their original, artful bursts of noise and imagery, seeing them in dark clubs in the '80s and beyond. From the time I first heard them in 1977, few bands have encapsulated my musical aesthetics like Wire.


And yet there they were, with three original bandmates: Colin Newman, singing his enigmatic poetry, and those driving rhythms of Graham Lewis on bass and Robert Grey (aka Robert Gotobed) on]]</description><pubDate>2020-06-01T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qSYuOYHR8M</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qSYuOYHR8M</guid>

June 1, 2020 | Stephen Thompson -- You can probably guess that we recorded the original Broadway cast of Hadestown before the coronavirus pandemic made live theater (live anything) an untenable risk. The reminders are everywhere — in the way 16 performers bunch up behind the desk, singing formidably in close proximity as a large crowd gathers just off camera — that this took place in the Before-Times. To be specific, on March 2.

We'd actually been trying to put this show together since the spring of 2019, when Hadestown was a freshly Tony-nominated hit musical. We hit several]]</description><pubDate>2020-06-08T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKwDFDDr_VA</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKwDFDDr_VA</guid>

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | June 18, 2020 
I was very conflicted as I watched Little Dragon's Tiny Desk (home) concert. The group's latest album, New Me, Same Us, is their grooviest, most concentrated in years, and I was eager to hear these songs as Little Dragon's music is best experienced: live on stage. "Some of you might know that we were supposed to be on tour in the states, but due to these crazy times it got canceled," lead singer Yukimi Nagano says. On that same token, these stripped-down iterations from the band's home studio in Sweden move me but in a different way. I find myself focusing on the songwriting and how all the instruments come together for these numbers, proving just how strong the tracks from New Me..]]</description><pubDate>2020-06-18T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koveFxBb3FU</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koveFxBb3FU</guid>

🎤 Lyrics: Ellie Goulding - Love Me Like You Do

You're the light, you're the night
You're the colour of my blood
You're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much, so much

You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me to the dark
Let me take you past our satellites
You can see the world you brought to life, to life

So love me ]]</description><pubDate>2020-07-11T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGdH0Lm7f0I</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGdH0Lm7f0I</guid>

Bogurodzica – najstarsza polska pieśń religijna i najstarszy zachowany polski tekst poetycki wraz z melodią. Utwór powstał w średniowieczu, najprawdopodobniej na przełomie XIII i XIV wieku.  Autor tekstu pozostaje nieznany. Pierwszy zapis tekstu pochodzi z 1407, wcześniej tekst mógł krążyć w obiegu ustnym. Pieśń śpiewana była przez polsko-litewskie wojska tuż przed bitwą pod Grunwaldem. W 1506 roku tekst pieśni został dołączony do Statutów Jana Łaskiego z błędną informacją, że jej autorem jest św. Wojciech, ponieważ nie znał on języka polskiego. Na przestrzeni wieków XIV–XVIII Bogurodzica (w wersji starobiał. Багародзіца) pełniła także rolę hymnu państwowego Wielkiego Księstwa Litewskiego. Dziś jest śpiewana jako pieśń patriotyczna.

Bogurodzica is the oldest Polish anthem. It was composed somewhere between the 10th and 13th centuries.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bobby Carter | August 24, 2020
With beats, effects and synths pumping through a DJ mixer sitting on a school desk in his home studio in Australia, we present Tame Impala like you've never heard it before. As much as I love Tame Impala's music, I'm probably more intrigued by the creative process that brings the songs to life. The studio version of the band is pretty simple on paper: All songs are written, produced and performed by Kevin Parker. For the live version, Parker is still front and center but surrounded by a host of musicians who interpret his recorded work almost to a tee.

So it came as a shock to me when the Australian maestro explained what he wanted to do for his Tiny Desk (home) concert or his "Ta]]</description><pubDate>2020-08-24T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24hUt18RWY</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C24hUt18RWY</guid>

Try to travel with your mind: back in time, desert lands, cactus, dusty roads and a long journey.  Think of stopping somewhere beautiful at the end of the trip refreshing your soul with a cold beer and a breathtaking landscape view "...From The Earth To The Sky" is the perfect soundtrack for a mind travel or a real journey on a hot hot summertime day. Acoustic and electric guitars, percussion, banjo and pedal steel mixed with mellow vocals that let you dream away. This is the band’s sophomore album and is composed of 14 songs. 

The first part of the album is inspired by a classic country attitude mixed with a spaghetti western sound.

Ensemble: Anonymous & Strada
http://www.facebook.com/musicamedievale
•
For many years now, ensemble Strada has been exploring Mediterranean music which continues to draw from medieval tradition. Strada's rendition of the few scores that have been handed down to us from Middle Ages, which they perform in that most excellent of medieval forums, "nella strada", in the street, makes their music aliveand colorful, and much like the music which rang through southern Europe from thirteenh to the sixteenth centuries.
The selection chosen for this recording were performed by Strada during the first Medievales de Québec festival in 1993 - music that the washerwoman and the court jester once dance to, music that cotribuited to magical atmosphere of the carnival.

Trapped in a cavern, it’s pitch black and the air is getting harder and harder to breathe. Disoriented, hands follow the walls to find what could be the ceiling, fingers digging into the rock to find something– anything– loose to help point toward a direction out. Suddenly, a rock frees itself and after clearing away some dirt, a pin of blinding light shines through the enveloping darkness. Clearing away soil and rock with more and more vigor, hope and salvation is just a short way from here.

This is PG.LOST’s Oscillate– the band’s latest LP packed to the gills with pure drama and catharsis.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Dec. 4, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- With a genuine smile stretched across her face, Dua Lipa seems overjoyed to reconnect with her band for their only performance since their tour in support of her sophomore album, Future Nostalgia, was cancelled in March. Glowing from the inside out and accentuated by the apricot hues of a backdrop in a London studio, Dua and her backup vocalists and band bring life and warmth into households in need of "levitating" and some pep in their step this winter. This vibrant four song set of dance hits, all from Future Nostalgia, will surely have you cutting up the floor in your kitchen while quarantining in the cold weather.
