So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell,
Blue skys from pain.
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?

And did they get you to trade
Your heros for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?

How I wish, how I wish you were here.
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl,
Year after year,
Running over the same old ground.
What have we found?
The same old fears.
Wish you were here.]]</description><pubDate>1975-04-05T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXdNnw99-Ic</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXdNnw99-Ic</guid>

<item><title>![CDATA[Pink Floyd - Shine On You Crazy Diamond [Official Music Video]]]</title><description>![CDATA[Video Description:
"Shine On You Crazy Diamond" is a nine-part Pink Floyd composition written by Roger Waters, Richard Wright and David Gilmour. It is a tribute to former band member Syd Barrett. The song was first performed on their 1974 French tour, and recorded for their 1975 concept album Wish You Were Here. The song was intended to be a side-long composition (like "Atom Heart Mother" and "Echoes"), but was ultimately split into two parts and used to bookend the album, with new material composed that was more relevant to this song, and to the situation in which the band found themselves.

Lyrics:

Remember when you were young, you shone like the sun.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
Now there's a look in your eyes, like black holes in the sky.
Shine on you crazy diamond.
You were caught in the cross fire of childhood and stardom.]]</description><pubDate>1975-06-05T00:00:00+00:00</pubDate><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWGE9Gi0bB0</link></item><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWGE9Gi0bB0</guid>

The official 'Bohemian Rhapsody' music video. Taken from Queen - 'Greatest Video Hits 1'. Lyrics below:

Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooo
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come

<item><title>![CDATA[Pink Floyd - Welcome to the Machine (Official Music Video)]]</title><description>![CDATA["Welcome to the Machine" is the second song on Pink Floyd's 1975 album Wish You Were Here. The song is said to be inspired by George Orwell's book 1984, in which a man is trying to escape the government which is brainwashing its citizens with TV shows and oppressive rules.

The iconic video was created by Gerald Scarfe initially as a backdrop film for when the band played the track on its 1977 In the Flesh tour.
